# Friend Finder

> Friend Finder implements friend matching based on the user's responses to a ten question survey.

## Getting Started
To install the application:

cd friend-finder
npm install

To run the application locally and access it in your browser, first set the PORT environment variable to the value of your choice, i.e. PORT=8080
Run the Node.js application with the command --> node server.js
The application will now be running locally on PORT and you can access it locally from your browser at the URL localhost:PORT.
